## Instructions to Set Up Project Using GitHub

1. **Download the Files:**
   - Click on the "Download" button in the GitHub repository to get all the project files.
   - Save the downloaded files into a new folder on your computer.

2. **Set Up Local Database:**
   - Install Xampp or any other suitable application to manage your local database.
   - Open Xampp and start the Apache and MySQL services.

3. **Create a Database:**
   - Open the Xampp control panel and click on the "Admin" button for MySQL. This will open phpMyAdmin in your web browser.
   - In phpMyAdmin, find the "Database" tab and create a new database named "mystudents".

4. **Import Database File:**
   - In phpMyAdmin, select the "mystudents" database from the left sidebar.
   - Look for the "Import" option in the top menu and click on it.
   - Choose the "mystudents.sql" file from your downloaded project folder and click "Go" to import the data into the database.

5. **Start the Project:**
   - Ensure you have a local server running (Xampp should have started the Apache service).
   - Move the entire project folder into the "htdocs" folder of your Xampp installation directory.
   - Open your web browser and enter "localhost/your_project_folder" in the address bar.
   - The project should now be accessible, and you can interact with it on your local server.

That's it! You have successfully set up the project locally using the files from GitHub and imported the necessary database. You can now explore and use the project on your computer. If you encounter any issues, don't hesitate to seek help or clarify any doubts. Happy coding!
